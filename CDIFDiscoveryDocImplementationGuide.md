title: CDIF Discovery Document Classes and Properties
date: 2026-05-30

# Introduction

This document includes all of the classes and properties for CDIF Discovery Documents using the schema.org vocabulary. The schema is composed from 1) cdifCore, which includes classes and properties containing content that is required in every valid CDIF instance, and a set of classes and properties that are expected to be applicable to a wide variety of datasets across knowledge domains; 2) cdifDiscovery, which defines additional optional classes and properties applicable for many (but not all) kinds of resources. For both the required and optional properties, this profile provides recommendations for implementation that will enable interoperability. As used here, classes are named objects with a set of named properties, each of which has an expected data type that specifies its value. Datatypes can be simple literals (number, string, boolean), references to objects that are not serialized inline, or instances of a class. Conformance to this document specification entails populating all mandatory content, and using the recommended classes and properties for the optional content. The implementation target is an rdf serialization, which is an open world logical model; users are thus free to add additional properties that they find useful for dataset documentation in their community, but these can be ignored by other users without penalty.

The JSON syntax is defined by the [ECMA JSON specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/), and JSON-LD is specified in the [JSON-LD 1.1 recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This serialization is designed for linked data applications that will translate the JSON into a set of {subject, predicate, object} triples that can be loaded into an RDF database (triple-store) for processing. The JSON-LD context defines prefixes that are bound to the JSON keys to make them CURIEs-- abbreviated URIs for more precise semantics. The use of URIs to identify entities and property values in the metadata will maximize the linkage with resources on the wider web to build an ever-expanding global knowledge graph.

# Conformance

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

A resource declares conformand to the CDIF Discovery document specification when its catalog record declares conformance to both the Core and Discovery profile identifiers. The catalog record is carried on `schema:subjectOf` as a `dcat:CatalogRecord`:

```json
"schema:subjectOf": {
  "@type": ["schema:CreativeWork", "dcat:CatalogRecord"],
  "dcterms:conformsTo": [
    "https://w3id.org/cdif/core/1.1",
    "https://w3id.org/cdif/discovery/1.1"
  ]
}
```
The document must  implement all the required core requirements, and use all optional properties as specified in the core and discovery profile schema.

In brief, every conforming record must include:
- `@id`, `@type` (including `schema:Dataset`), and a JSON-LD `@context` with explicit prefixes;
- `schema:name` — a descriptive title;
- `schema:identifier` — the primary identifier (string or `schema:PropertyValue`);
- `schema:dateModified` — last-update date (ISO 8601);
- `schema:license` **or** `schema:conditionsOfAccess`;
- `schema:url` **or** `schema:distribution`;
- `schema:subjectOf` — the catalog record carrying the conformance declaration above.

The information model for the base discovery profile is defined in the [cdifBook](). This section specifies and implementation using JSON-LD for the content items defined in the information model. All classes and properties are implemented with schema.org types and attributes unless there is a prefix indicating use of elements from other vocabularies. See the context section for prefixes used and their mapping to URIs.

# Notes on schema.org implementation

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## JSON-LD \@type

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

JSON-LD every graph node has a \@type property that specifies the rdf:type for the node. This type has implications for the properties expected to be found in the content of the node, and should convey the intention of the kind of thing the node is intended to represent. In the CDIF JSON-LD implementation, most of the \@types are taken from the schema.org vocabulary, but there are a few exceptions for content items that do not map to the schema.org vocabulary. The \@type is always serialized as an array \[JSON list\] to allow for extensions that add additional typing.

## Object reference

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Linked data is implemented in rdf using URIs to reference objects that might be located in other parts of a graph, or remotely and accessed online. In the JSON-LD implementation, simply using a URI string as the value of a property does not create such a link---the value is simply a string, not the object reference by the URI. An \"object ref\" is always a string containing the id of the referenced object. Thus

*\"schema:funder\": \"<https://ror.org/021nxhr62>\"*

Does not create a link. Object references are implemented in JSON-LD as object that have a single node identifier as it property.

*\"schema:funder\": { \"@id\": \"https://ror.org/021nxhr62\" }*

Is the correct syntax to implemenat an object reference. Throughout this document, if \'object reference\' is included as a value type for a property, be aware that instance documents might simply have this kind of object as the property value.

## Repeating values

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Any property with a 1..\* or 0..\* cardinality has values that are always implemented as arrays. This makes client processing easier because tests for single or array values are not necessary. If a property is 'repeatable', then assume the implementation is an array (JSON list).

## Categorical Values

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Properties that have categorical values, i.e. terms that have a binding to a concept, the current implementation schema allow several options. These are 1. a simple string value; 2. a [schema.org defined term](https://schema.org/DefinedTerm), which includes name, identifier, inDefinedTermSet (link to authority vocabulary), and termCode (equivalent to skos:Notation); 3. a skos:Concept, as defined for cdif conceptScheme, which includes preferredLabel (name), identifier, inScheme (link to authority vocabulary), and notation (equivalent to schema:termCode). The schema also allows object reference (e.g. "@id":"..uri"} to an appropriate category representation. 

## Namespace prefixes and JSON validation.

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Namespace prefixes are explicitly used in the example documents so that the JSON schema can validate instance documents. JSON Schema validates the literal JSON structure \-- property names, nesting, value types. Several features of JSON-LD can cause a semantically correct document to fail JSON Schema checks. The same property can appear as \"schema:name\", \"name\", or \"http://schema.org/name\" depending on the @context. A JSON Schema that checks for \"schema:name\" will reject a document that uses \"name\", even though both mean the same thing. See [Validating CDIF Profile Metadata](https://github.com/Cross-Domain-Interoperability-Framework/validation/blob/main/docs/CDIF-profiles-metadata-validation.md) for a detailed discussion of validation processes for CDIF metadata, and the use of framing to validate JSON-LD instances using different [JSON-LD forms](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#forms-of-json-ld) or custom context documents..

The JSON Schema validates **one metadata record at a time**: the document root must be a single `schema:Dataset` node with the mandatory properties at the top level. A multi-record bundle packaged as `{ \"@graph\": [ ... ] }` \-- the natural output of many harvesters and federated catalogs \-- will fail JSON Schema validation immediately, because `@graph` is not in the schema property list. This is purely a packaging mismatch: the bundled records may be perfectly valid individually, and SHACL (which operates on the RDF graph rather than the JSON tree) will still pass them. Before JSON-Schema validation, extract each `schema:Dataset` record from the graph using JSON-LD framing. The `FrameAndValidate.py` script and `CDIFDiscoveryDoc-frame.jsonld` frame in this repository do exactly this \-- framing a document against the CDIF frame and extracting the dataset node out of `@graph` \-- and can be run with `--validate` to frame and JSON-Schema-validate in one step.

## Use of dcat:CatalogRecord

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

In a harvesting/federated catalog system some metadata about the metadata is useful to keep track of where metadata came from, what format/profile it uses (harvesters need this to process), and update dates. Unambiguous expression of this information requires making statements about a metadata record distinct from the thing in the world that the metadata describes. In an RDF framework, this requires a distinct identifier for the metadata record object that will serve as the subject for these triples.

In the RDF serialization, [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) metadata records are [JSON-LD node objects](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#node-objects), and include an \"@id\" keyword with a value that identifies the node, analogous to a primary key in a relational database. This identifier can be interpreted to represent a thing in the world that the metadata record (the \'node\') is about, or to represent the metadata record (a JSON object) itself.

To avoid this ambiguity, CDIF adopts the convention that the [schema.org](http://schema.org/) identifier property is used to identify a thing in the world that is the subject of the JSON-LD node. The identified thing might be physical, imaginary, abstract, or a digital object. The JSON-LD \@id property identifies a node in a graph, which is an abstract object. As a URI the \@id URI is expected to dereference to produce a JSON-LD object containing the properties that are attached to the graph node.

Given this convention, when the metadata record is processed, the processor should use the schema:identifier as subject of triples about the subject of the metadata record to avoid ambiguity. In addition, this convention would suggest that if a schema:identifier property is present, the \@id property should be interpreted to identify the JSON object that is the representation of the node in the knowledge graph. In practice JSON-LD processors use the \@id as the subject of triples generated from a JSON-LD object. A \'purist\' approach would require a level of indirection to assert that the \@id is about the thing identified by the schema:identifier. JSON-LD processors don\'t do this, so standard practice is to make the \@id the identifier for the described resource, requiring understanding that it identifies two things---the rdf object at that graph node, and the thing in the world described by the content of that node. This has worked for the most part because metadata providers have been quite lax in providing information about the provenance of the metadata node, and in particular the conformance criteria that were followed in generating the content of that node.

To address this issue, CDIF recommends that statements about the metadata record (the JSON object) as a distinct entity should be made using a separate identified node object. This node object is typed as a schema:Dataset, with additionalType [dcat:CatalogRecord](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Catalog_Record) recognizing that the DCAT v3 specification uses that element to address this precise issue. This node can be embedded in the Dataset metadata using the subjectOf property, and approach used in the accompanying JSON schema and examples, or implemented as a separate free standing graph node linked to the dataset object via the \'about\' [object reference](#object-reference).

Example instance with dcat catalog record content (mapped to schema.org properties):

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://schema.org",
    {
      "dcterms": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
      "ex": "https://example.com/99152/"
    }
  ],
  "@id": "ex:URIforNode1",
  "@type": "appropriate schema.org type",
  "identifier": "ex:URIforDescribedResource",
  "name": "unique title for the resource",
  "description": "Description of the resource",
  "subjectOf": {
    "@id": "ex:URIforNode2",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "additionalType": "dcat:CatalogRecord",
    "sdDatePublished": "2017-05-23",
    "about": {"@id": "ex:URIforNode1"},
    "description": "metadata about documentation for ex:URIforDescribedResource",
    "dcterms:conformsTo": [
      {"@id": "https://w3id.org/cdif/core/1.1"},
      {"@id": "https://w3id.org/cdif/discovery/1.1"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Polymorphism of PropertyValue

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

The schema.org PropertyValue type is used in several different contexts in the implementation of CDIF metadata. This is a result of how the expected values for some important properties are defined in schema.org. In the Discovery profile, PropertyValue is an allowed value type for variableMeasured and for identifier. In some more advanced profiles, PropertyValue is also an allowed value for additionalProperty.

The following table compared the properties and requirements for this schema.org type in these different contexts.

| Property | Description | identifier | variableMeasured | additionalProperty |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| @type | Type declaration (must contain schema:PropertyValue) | 1..* required, contains: PropertyValue | 1..* required, contains: PropertyValue | 1..* required, contains: PropertyValue |
| @id | URI identifier for this node | - | 0..1 string | - |
| schema:name | Human-readable label | - | 1 required string | 1 required string |
| schema:description | Textual description | - | 0..1 string, default: "missing" | - |
| schema:alternateName | Alternative names | - | 0..* array of strings | - |
| schema:propertyID | Identifier for the property concept | 0..1 string (identifier scheme name) | 0..* array of: string \| {@id} \| DefinedTerm | 1..* required array of: string \| {@id} \| DefinedTerm; minItems: 1 |
| schema:value | The property value | 0..1 (conditional) string; required if no schema:url | - | 1 required string \| number \| boolean \| object |
| schema:url | Web-resolvable URL | 0..1 (conditional) string (uri format); required if no schema:value | 0..1 string (uri) \| LabeledLink | - |
| schema:unitText | Unit of measurement as text | - | 0..1 string | 0..1 string |
| schema:unitCode | URI or code for unit of measure | - | 0..1 string \| {@id} \| DefinedTerm | 0..1 string \| DefinedTerm |
| schema:measurementTechnique | How values were obtained | - | 0..1 string \| {@id} \| DefinedTerm | - |
| schema:minValue | Minimum numeric value | - | 0..1 number | - |
| schema:maxValue | Maximum numeric value | - | 0..1 number | - |

# Namespaces

[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Namespace prefixes use in CDIF Discovery schema.org JSON-LD objects are specified by this JSON-LD context, which must be declared in every instance document. Note that the correct namespace URI for schema.org is '**http'**, not '**https'**. The [**https**://schema.org/](https://schema.org/) uri identifies the schema.org context document, not the namespace. This example context includes all the namespaces used in any cdif profile:

\"@context\": {\
\"schema\": \"http://schema.org/\",\
\"dcterms\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\",\
\"geosparql\": \"http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\",\
\"spdx\": \"http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#\",\
\"cdi\": \"http://ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-CDI/1.0/RDF/\",\
\"csvw\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw#\",\
\"prov\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\",\
\"time\": \"http://www.w3.org/2006/time#\",\
\"dqv\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/dqv#\",\

- **Description:** The technique, technology, or methodology used for measurement or determination of the dataset values.

#### variableMeasured

- **Cardinality:** Optional, Repeatable
- **Content:** [PropertyValue-(variableMeasured)](#propertyvalue-variablemeasured)
- **Description:** Use schema:PropertyValue to describe the variables assigned values in the dataset. Provide names, labels used in the data serialization, definitions, propertyID as a link to formal property definitions. Min and max values that occur in numeric data to support search criteria based on observed values.

#### spatialCoverage

- **Cardinality:** Optional, Repeatable
- **Content:** [Place](#place)
- **Description:** Document spatial extent to which the resource content is relevant. Can be expressed with a simple text place name, a place name from an identified gazeteer (using schema: [DefinedTerm](#defined-term)), a point location, a bounding box (.e.g. for a map extent), a line (e.g. a ship track or foot traverse), or a general geometry. Registered place names from a gazeteer or a simple bounding box are widely recognized and indexed approaches used by spatially aware metadata aggregators.
- **Example -- multi-country coverage.** When a resource covers several countries, repeat `schema:spatialCoverage` with one [Place](#place) per country. Each `Place` carries the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as `schema:name` and `schema:identifier`, and a `schema:sameAs` link to the EU Publications Office country authority (which keys on the alpha-3 code). A `Place` is valid with any one of `schema:geo`, `schema:name`, or `schema:identifier`; this form uses `name` and `identifier`.

```json
"schema:spatialCoverage": [
  {
    "@type": "schema:Place",
    "schema:name": "BE",
    "schema:identifier": "BE",
    "schema:sameAs": "http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/BEL"
  },
  {
    "@type": "schema:Place",
    "schema:name": "NL",
    "schema:identifier": "NL",
    "schema:sameAs": "http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/NLD"
  },
  {
    "@type": "schema:Place",
    "schema:name": "LU",
    "schema:identifier": "LU",
    "schema:sameAs": "http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/LUX"
  }
]
```

#### temporalCoverage

For documentation of Earth Science, Paleobiology or Paleontology datasets, we are interested in the second case\-- the time period that data are linked to thematically. NOTE---the implementation of temporal intervals uses OWL Time, so the context must include \"time\": [http://www.w3.org/2006/time#](http://www.w3.org/2006/time). Simple ISO8601 time intervals can be represented using the description property with a text string value.
- **Recommended:** for coverage statements that can be expressed in calendar time, use ISO 8601 interval notation as a plain string value \-- two ISO 8601 dates separated by a `/` (for example, `1997/1998` or `1997-06-01/1998-05-31`); `..` may be used as an open start or end bound. The `time:ProperInterval` form is intended for intervals that cannot be expressed in calendar time, such as those bounded by named ordinal eras or by numeric positions in a non-calendar temporal reference system (e.g. geologic time).

#### name

- **Cardinality:** Required
- **Content:** string
- **Description:** A descriptive name of a dataset (e.g., \'Snow depth in Northern Hemisphere\'). The name should uniquely identify the described resource for human use, in the scope of the metadata catalog containing this metadata record. Schema.org property, in namepace \'http://schema.org/\'.

Sources of license identifiers: https://opensource.org/licenses/, https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/, https://spdx.org/licenses/, http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/swl. If only a string is provided, it should be recognizable name for the license. If resolvable URI is available, use the object reference.

- **CHOICE at least one of two options:**

#### url

- **Cardinality:** Required if no distribution
- **Content:** string.uri

#### subjectOf

- **Cardinality:** Required
- **Content:** [Dataset/dcat:CatalogRecord](#datasetdcatcatalogrecord)
- **Description:** This property contains information about the metadata record itself, as opposed to the resource the record describes. See Uses of dcat:CatalogRecord and https://github.com/Cross-Domain-Interoperability-Framework/Discovery/issues/13 for discussion on how to make assertion about the metadata record distinct from statements about the described resource. Use the dcat:CatalogRecord as additionalType to distinguish this schema:Dataset from the schema:Dataset about a described external resource. see <https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/contentmodel.html#properties-for-metadata-management>. Introduction of this is novel for schema.org implementations.

The embedded catalog record's `dcterms:conformsTo` MUST list **both** `https://w3id.org/cdif/core/1.1` and `https://w3id.org/cdif/discovery/1.1`. The Discovery profile composes the CDIF Core profile, so the JSON Schema carries the Core conformance constraint in addition to the Discovery one; an instance declaring only the Discovery URI will fail validation. See [conformsTo](#conformsto) under Dataset/dcat:CatalogRecord.
